🕒 Average session 5-10 minutes

Easy to learn 🟢

Setting - Sci-Fi (X-com) 👽

Synopsis - you are a lone operative in the enemy territory. You must break through the crowds of enemies in order to kill your main enemy - your former partner.

The essence of the game is a dice roll 🎲 it determines how far you can run on your turn. Enemies 👾 and useful items🔫 will be randomly waiting for you on the cells.

Each enemy has a number of lives ❤️ and an attack ⚔️. Attack shows how much the enemy reduces your life each turn. The number of lives shows you how many points after the roll of the die you need to score to kill the enemy.

Items scattered randomly across the map can enhance your attack or restore life.

Each player starts with 100 lives ❤️ and the attack is equal to the number rolled on the dice. Items can increase attack, for example +2 pistol will make your attack on a roll of a 4 becomes 6.

At the end of the game, you will meet your nemesis - your former partner and you must defeat him in a fair battle - with a dice roll.
